# GraphQLGen Example

This example consists of two parts:

## Part 1

Use the GraphQL schema to generate the Julia types and functions. Shown [here](./generate.jl). The schema used in this example was taken from https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql/blob/master/schema.graphql. It is a wrapper around the SWAPI API. 
## Part 2

Use the generated Julia types. Shown [here](./example.jl)
